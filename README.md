## Overview

Hi! This is a quick scraper project, to get the contracts data from doge website. I also enriched it with some information on the contract page (NAICS, Legal Business Name etc).

The folders are
-> Data
- Has the CSVs with the contracts information

-> Scraper
- Has some iterations of the scrapers I created, to get both the data from doge, as well as from the contract links

-> Analysis
- Some quick filters and checks with a jupyter notebook

## Extra

I might try to improve this, crossreferencing the company data, but I'm still searching for a good option to get that
