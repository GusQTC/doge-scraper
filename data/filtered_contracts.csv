USAID," The United States Agency for International Development s Investing in Independent Media (IIM) aims to ensure  the viability of independent media as a critical element of Myanmar s emerging democracy. The Activity will support public interest journalism created  by local and national media houses and independent journalists. The activity recognizes that there is not yet a sufficiently mature business environment for the media to operate independently while continuing to report news that holds political and economic elites accountable. The availability of news and information is a key piece of countering disinformation and misinformation in Myanmar.

The performance objectives of the activity are to  (1) Increase research and analysis for use by, and about the media sector and business environment, for the primary use and benefit of decision making by media operations (2) Alleviate political, financial, and legal pressures on media houses and journalists that publish news and investigative reports  (3) Increase financial independence and viability of local and national media.  IIM will expand on USAID Burma’s current and past investments in the media sector, while working closely to align activities with other donor support that follow similar priorities.

IIM will be managed by USAID Burma s Office for Democracy, Governance, and Humanitarian Assistance (DGHA) as part of a broader portfolio supporting democracy, governance, conflict mitigation, and resilience activities designed to protect human rights, advance the democratic transition, and support peace in Myanmar.

to deepen and diversify the WH funding streams so that they can become more financially
sustainable and better able to strategically plan longer-term programs and avoid funding cliffs
that threaten core operations. While they will engage in fundraising with the WH team, the
